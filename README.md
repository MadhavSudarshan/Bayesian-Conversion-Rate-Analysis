# Bayesian-Conversion-Rate-Analysis

- Estimate the conversion rate of an e-commerce website using Bayesian analysis.
- Provide credible intervals and posterior distributions for the conversion rate.
- Visualize the results to gain insights into the conversion rate variability.


### Step 1: Data Generation
We will generate a synthetic dataset representing user visits and conversions on an e-commerce website. I used Python's Numpy library to create this dataset. This code creates a dataset with 1,000 visitors and a true conversion rate of 10% (0.1).

### Step 2: Data Exploration and Visualization
I used pandas and matplotlib to explore and visualize the dataset. The code creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of conversions.

### Step 3: Bayesian Modeling and Analysis
I performed Bayesian analysis using the PyMC3 library.This code defines a Bayesian model with a Beta prior and Binomial likelihood, then samples from the posterior distribution using MCMC.

### Step 4: Visualization of Bayesian Results
I visualized the Bayesian results using PyMC3 and matplotlib libraries. These visualizations include trace plots of the MCMC chains and a posterior distribution plot with credible intervals.

### Step 5: Interpretation and Conclusion
Finally, I interpreted the results, including the credible intervals and what they imply about the conversion rate. In this synthetic example, I compared the estimated conversion rate to the known true value.
